# So, you want a job, eh?

I'm tired of all the common advice that people give out. Study this, think out loud, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, OK. Well, here's *my* advice. I'll try not to rehash any of the usual bullshit.

Before any of that though. I want to be empathetic and realistic: to you and to myself. There is no guarantee you will get the job you want. Your career is something that you [drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity). You can choose a general direction you want to exert a force towards and start drifting, exhibiting random motion backwards, forwards, up-down-sideways while trending towards your overarching choices. The highest paying jobs, using only pay as your metric, are the most competitive jobs. You will face strong global competition if pay is your only metric for a job searching. Jobs sometimes market themselves as 'for university graduates' or 'early in career': these are all empty words. In any given job you could be competing with someone who has a PhD or 20 years of experience, definitely if you are after the highest paying ones. There is no guarantee you will get the highest paying job in your field. Nepotism is real at every level and company. Being the top talent in a field of choice is not easy and not opportunistic. It requires as much luck as it does hard work. 

Your career and job are abstract concepts that you can build a relationship with. They don't define you as a person. Do you only think about friendships and romantic relationships in terms of money and perks? You want a job that lets you live a reasonable and satisfying life. There are many. You should look for a job that: (1) has kind coworkers (2) lets you learn something new often (3) is enjoyable to you (4) pays you enough for you to live comfortably (5) doesn't ask you to sacrifice your life for some farcical feature deadline.

## Assumptions

You have hidden assumptions about existence and how the world around you operates. I will put your thoughts (what used to be mine) in __bold font__.

1. __I want a good job.__ No. There are no good jobs, only jobs that don't hold you back from living a good life. What you want is a good *life*. Using your job to define your life will leave you unsatisfied. Nobody can steal away the goodness of your life. If you want it then you can get it by giving it to yourself. Sacrificing or changing your current life so you can get the job you want is not particularly good planning. Live the life you want to live, and if your getting that job doesn't fit into it (in a capacity you feel comfortable with, of course), then change your intentions and expectations. Work towards your goals while giving yourself the present moment.

2. __People and companies know what they are doing__. People and companies are inefficient and disorganized. All of them. I once was interviewing for an internship at a big tech company and my recruiter got fired/left without handing me off to another. I followed up a few times but I was unable to contact them. I went to their LinkedIn after following up a few times over the course of a few weeks only to find out they were working at a completely different company, and by this time the positions had filled up.

3. __If I interview well I will get the job__. You can be the most perfect candidate and interviewee and still not get the job. The position may be filled before your feedback is entered, an interviewer may spite you with mediocre feedback even though you thought you did great, the department may decide to pause all hiring, the hiring manager may quit or get fired without handing off potential hires - anything can happen. Nothing is promised. The American Dream™ only promises what is average to America. The \[Insert Country] Dream only promises what is average to \[Insert Country]. The median salary, company size, home size: open your eyes to the average to understand what a country and society truly promises you.

4. __The interviewer will guide me if I communicate effectively. An interview is a logical conversation between two people.__ The interviewer is not there to help you. A really good software engineer and interviewer (1%) will give you a great open-ended problem and do their best to understand you and lead you down the path they feel is best for getting you to code out an epic solution. (~98%) of interviewers are just tuned out. They don't care about the interview. They don't care whether you pass or understand the question. They just want to get on with the interview and ask the same canned questions they ask to everyone else, put in their feedback and go back to work. They already have a job at the company - why does it matter to them whether you get the job or not? And, unfortunately, (1%) of interviewers are spiteful. They want you to fail because they like watching the world burn. They ask hard questions because they were asked hard questions and feel vengeful justice while doling out the punishment and hazing on potential candidates.

5. __If I study enough I will be able to pass any interview.__ Interviews are not a meritocracy. Soft skills do matter. Networking does matter. Being a software engineer is more about manipulating computers than becoming them.

6. __I make a similar amount to my colleagues.__ Possibly. You'd be surprised how much more or less you make than them. Companies are not fair. I am neutral on salary sharing with colleagues. 

7. It's OK. Everything is.

__Meh__


1. Apply to 10 jobs per day at the minimum. Don't set arbitrary minimums like 100 jobs per day. You will overwhelm yourself. Do NOT, under any circumstances, burn yourself out over a job search. Just assume that the potential hit-rate of your applications will fall somewhere between 5% - 20%. I like to assume that the hit-rate is 10%. So applying to 10 jobs per day should net you at least 1 recruiter call per batch. You don't even have to actually apply to 10 jobs. Think of it like lead generation. Adding technical recruiters on LinkedIn (get them 500+ connections, bruh) and following hiring managers and developers on Twitter also happens to be meaningful lead generation, something that could potentially lead you to a job opportunity.

2. My opinion is that cover letters are useless. If you're supposed to write a 1 page resume because nobody has time to read anything longer than a 1 page resume, then why would they bother or have time to read your cover letter? I don't have all the answers. There is a lot of opinion on this.

3. Don't list technical skills on your resume that you can't have an intellectual conversation about.

4. Optimize your job search so that your resume matches at least 50% of what they require in a candidate in their job description. If they have a bullet point like 'we want great problem solvers', well, you're a great problem solver, right? If you can even match 50% of what you consider to be their BS then go ahead and apply for it. It's not like they know what they want. Most companies just want a pool of resumes and to pick out and interview a few of the top candidates in the pool. Who knows what the pool looks like and whether you'll land near the top of it. Shoot.

5. Keep a spreadsheet of companies that you have applied to. Don't put the dates or the job descriptions/titles or your status in the process on this sheet. It will overwhelm you. Just the names.

6. Referrals are the best chance you have at converting an application to an interview.

7. Cold-emailing recruiters, hiring managers and engineers could potentially work. Guess their emails, download an email finder Chrome extension, or maybe [scrape every GitHub user](https://github.com/nealav/github-scraper). You can use Google for this with potential search queries like `site:linkedin.com technical recruiter "@fb.com"`.

## [Technical Interviewing](https://github.com/nealav/interviewing)

1. Don't buy CTCI or any of the related interview prep books or courses. I've read them and I don't think they are useless, but I don't think they deserve any monetary gain from propagating a boring standard throughout the industry. Go pirate them. It is easy to find their PDFs online.

2. Don't fall into the input trap. An interviewer may present you with a question about a Binary Search Tree and give you an array as the representation of it and ask you perform some sort of traversal through it. You don't have to assume you need to operate on the array representation of the BST. You can simply say that you are assuming the tree is built and has a root node with left and right nodes that will be the argument passed into the function. Use the easiest representation of the data for you to complete the algorithm. You don't need to build the underlying data structures for a question that is primarily algorithmically focused. If your interviewer says that you are not allowed to assume that and you should build the tree up if you need it, go ahead and write the algorithm *first*, then build the underlying data structures.

3. If you're stuck, don't give up. Sometimes you will find yourself in a situation where you can't figure out the next path to go down. What you should immediately do is write or draw out more example inputs and outputs to your problem to help you gain a better understanding of the problem space and what you should do. This will help you clarify the problem to yourself and will also help you clarify your understanding of how they asked the problem to you while also establishing your logicial thought processes and testing mindset.

4. Psuedocode is OK. Psuedocode is better than no code or wrong code. If you are having trouble writing the actual code of a problem out, then write the psuedocode and start writing the code one piece at a time. Use the functional programming paradigm of transferring data from one block of code to another. If you need a dictionary later on in your code that is structured a certain way for this piece of code to work, don't work on the construction of the dictionary yet, but work on how it will be used in your algorithm, making the assumption that you will be using a dictionary of X structure (make a code comment of the structure). Build your code backwards first and top-down. Focus on the algorithm not the structure and composition of the inputs.

5. Don't present your interviewer with multiple solutions that could shoot you in the foot. If you can think of multiple solutions to a problem, then pick the one that is easiest for you to code within the time given to you. Your interviewer may fixate you on a certain solution although you may have trouble coding it. They may even focus you on a solution that you haven't fully explained to yourself, thus leading you down a path of coding the completely wrong solution as they misinterepreted your understading of the question. Code what you know you can. Code what you know is right. An interview is not a 'conversation' betwen you and the interviewer. A good interview might be. But most interviews are not good interviews.

6. Don't fall into the running-your-code-into-infinite-debugging trap. There is no need to run your code on an online editor just to 'see if it works' or 'test it out'. First, reassure your solution with your interviewer as the one you are going to code. Next, write all of your code out in the solution from beginning to end. Don't bother running the code before you write it all out. A good interviewer would rather see your thought process and logical coding skills than working code, although both are best. If your run your code before it is all written out logically then you may encounter random bugs that need to be fixed, like string parsing, one-off errors, appending to the end vs. the beginning etc. You don't want to be fixing these bugs without having the logical solution coded out. They make you seem stupid and weak, and waste your precious interview time. Plus, a fully logical solution serves as its own psuedocode even if it doesn't entirely work. This is in your benefit. At the end of it all after you do this, and run through a few scenarios in your head, and after asking your interviewer 'do you see any issues or logical errors?', if your interviewer says something like 'why don't you give it a run?', then you can run it. You probably will encounter bugs on any non-trivial problem. This is fine. Start debugging the solution that you and your interviewer both agree 'should work' after establishing the common ground.

## Behavioral Interviewing

1. Collect stories. They don't have to explicitly be your stories either. You can practice the art of storytelling outside the lines of what is yours and what is not. The entire credit for the present belongs to all of the past.

2. Assume an identity or a persona. Everybody has a persona or personality type that they mesh well with. You can become a thinker, an empiricist, a goofball, a whatever-whoist in order to mesh well with your interviewer and others. Be flexible with your personality. If being you isn't working so well in the moment, then be someone else temporarily.

3. Create the illusion of an iceberg. You may respect and admire people that resemble giant glaciers. Piles and piles of solidified knowledge and expertise. It takes time to get to that point. Strive to create the illusion of being an iceberg, no matter what you actually consider yourself. Icebergs can have the same terrifyingly powerful knowledge as any mountain of ice. They *can*. 90% is beneath the water. If you can't project your knowledge outwardly and visibily in the moment, project it inwardly and under the water. Any good fantasy or scifi writer would tell you this: give the reader the illusion of depth. Plant in their head the seeds of knowledge that you have but let them grow without you nuturing them. If someone had to read a massive prologue of fact dumping and storybuilding they'd get tired and bored. You also don't have to nuture everything and say everything outright for you to convey what you need to.

## Epilogue

1. Write down all your advices and learnings (and send them to me!). Go make a GitHub repo right now where after every interview you write down at least one thing you learned (technically, behaviorally etc.). It will help your career and be a great reference guide to yourself and others as you go through your journey (also it will help you get them daily green blocks, bruh). When you are 40 or 50 it will be an absolute blast to see how your thinking evolved and changed.

2. Keep track of your journey. Go make another repo of general career (or otherwise!) things you've done. You read a book and liked it? Throw it down in a list somewhere. You saw a repo you liked? Throw it down! We all keep giant piles of bookmarks. I think it is more fun to keep them in repos. I enjoy cataloguing. It motivates me to keep adding more things I liked and have done. Plus if anyone asks you for career advice or life advice you can point them to your repo of things you liked/helped you, and the community will be so much better off.

3. Always be applying. Make sure you can do at least 1 phone screen per week. Applying enough to get about 1 phone screen per week should be considered part of your job (about 10 jobs per week should be target). Even if you fail the phone screen that's fine. You should want to be able to pass phone screens though. Keep track of different interviewing techniques and difficulties of interviewing at various companies.
