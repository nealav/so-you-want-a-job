# Advices 

* (Google PS x2) Absolutely slayed. Mic drop. Sidenote: If a recruiter asks for your compensation range before the onsite, what?
* (Google OS) Organize your thoughts better. Take a pause and list out questions you would ask yourself in a systems design interview.
* (Google OS) You destroyed the coding questions. Give yourself more credit and you will be less nervous and anxious overall.
* (Google OS) Are all behavioral interviews just one large jumbled up self help therapy session where you play the therapist and the client?
* (Google OS) I've still yet to determine whether if an interviewer not talking as much as you are in a systems design interview (aka having a conversation) means that they are going to write shit feedback about you.
* (Google Overall) Rejected. Well, not my best I guess. I think to win over a systems design interview you need to design a system that even the interviewers are excited to keep moving forward with and asking questions about.
* (Verily PS) Interviewers your age actually seem to help you out more than the older ones. Be less nervous and more chill.
* (Verily OS) This coding question was amazing and the interviewer motivated me to write better code than I've written in my whole life. Why can't all interviewers be like this?
* (Verily OS) I've yet to determine whether an interviewer telling you that you can "look it up" for syntax means they are basically going to fail you regardless of whether you come up with a working solution or they are empathetic towards you. Also, if they leave during the interview to get water or some shit and don't talk at all I guess it means you basically fail. Why are some interviewers so mean?
* (Verily OS) Ugh. I will never ever build the underlying data structure to a problem again. Fuck. Always assume that the input is in the format you find easiest to work with. Fuck parsing. Focus on the algorithm. Focus on the *algorithm*.
* (Verily OS) Yeah. LCS + Edit Distance. Needed some studying. Interviewers need to learn how to not just say "no" to all your ideas and try to hint you in the right direction with more "yes"s. Got lost in the thicket of "no"s. Take a pause and think. Write psuedocode if you are stuck, immediately.
* (Verily Overall) Rejected. One of the interviewers was amazing, another just alright, another sucky-ish and one just flat-out terrible, ugh. I'm pretty sure to ace any onsite you need to have at least a definite majority of good interviewers, so 2 (50% ain't gonna cut it), gotta be 3 out of 4 in this case. Woop.
* (Splunk PS) Love this interviewer. Great question. Awesome encouragement. Every great interview I've had always begins with the interviewer encouraging the interviewee and specifying the guidelines of the interview. They also ask a question that is very clear with a set of inputs to test against. Lovely.
* (Splunk OS) Pretty easy. I like having conversations with fun people. Actually, I think starting with the more easy interviewers and leading into harder ones actually gets you warmed up and less scared -> allows you to be more confident overall. More companies should adopt this.
* (Splunk OS) More complex behavior stuff. Enjoyable, really.
* (Splunk OS) More complicated coding questions. Still not so bad. Got them all. Interviewers need to clarify questions better. Having the candidate take on the entire burden of assumption, clarification and solution is bit a much. Possible, but much.
* (Splunk OS) Really great conversation. May have paused for too long on a question. Some questions you need to pause to reword your strong stories to fit the agenda, innit?
* (Splunk Overall) Rejected. Really? They even emailed me back the same night asking what would be the best time to chat so I thought they were excited abut my feedback. And then I get an email a week later saying the position is filled. Whaaat. Oh, well.

# Old Tidbits

* (Compass OS) NYC offices are so damn slick. Your nervousness as a new grad is overrated. Act more confident and ask more questions if you are unclear. Breathe.
* (Facebook PS) Study harder.
* (Google PS) If I studied harder to get an internship off the phone screens life would be easier. *sigh*
* (Google OS, CSE) Not as hard as I expected. Hope is overrated. You can get rejected from a job for any reason. Get a good sleep more than ever. Also, if someone says they want to walk up 10 flights of stairs instead of take the elevator to get to your interview room - don't accept.
* (Intel OS) Purely behavioral questions only. A team looking to hire an SDE on purely behavioral sense will make you fight for your right to code well and often.
